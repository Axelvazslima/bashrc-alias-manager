# Alias Manager

Alias Manager is a Python script that helps you efficiently manage command-line aliases in your `~/.bashrc` file. It organizes aliases into groups (e.g., Git commands, Docker commands, etc.), preventing duplication and ensuring better readability by maintaining an auto-generated section.

## Features

- **Group-based Alias Management**: Adds aliases in categorized sections.
- **Avoids Duplicates**: Ensures that existing aliases are not duplicated.
- **Auto-Generated Section**: Keeps aliases structured under a dedicated marker.
- **Interactive Menu**: Allows users to easily add, list, and create custom aliases.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alias-manager.git
   cd alias-manager
   ```

2. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended).

3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python3 alias_manager.py
   ```

## Usage

When running the script, you will be presented with an interactive menu:

1. **Add aliases from predefined groups**: Choose from main commands, Git commands, and Docker commands.
2. **Create custom alias**: Define a new alias and command manually.
3. **List all aliases**: View existing aliases in `~/.bashrc`.
4. **Exit**: Quit the script.

### Example Alias Groups

#### Main Commands:
```sh
alias l='ls'
alias cl='clear'
```

#### Git Commands:
```sh
alias gst='git status'
alias ga='git add'
```

#### Docker Commands:
```sh
alias dps='docker ps'
alias dc='docker container'
```

## How It Works

- The script first checks for a special marker in `~/.bashrc`:
  ```sh
  -----AUTO GENERATED BY AV PYTHON SCRIPT -----
  ```
- If the marker doesnâ€™t exist, it adds one.
- When adding aliases, the script organizes them under sections like:
  ```sh
  -----MAIN COMMANDS-----
  alias l='ls'
  alias cl='clear'
  ```
- Custom aliases can be manually added through the menu.
